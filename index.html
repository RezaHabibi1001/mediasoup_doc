        This documentation provides an overview of  socket event handlers used in a media server application. These event handlers include "producerClosed", "exitRoom", "join", and  others. Each event handler serves a specific purpose, such as handling producer closure, user room exit, adding peers to rooms, and more. The documentation explains the code logic, usage, and provides code examples for each event handler. These socket event handlers are crucial for managing rooms, peers, and media streaming in the media server application. By understanding and implementing these event handlers effectively, developers can enhance the functionality and performance of their media server applications.

<h1>Socket for Creating and Adding Rooms to Room List</h1>

  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <p>
    To create a room and add it to the room list, emit the <code>createRoom</code> event to the server with the following payload:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
{
  room_id: "&lt;room_id&gt;"
}
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    The server will respond with a callback containing the result of the operation.
  </p>

  <h3>Code Explanation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The <code>socket.on('createRoom', ...)</code> function listens for the <code>createRoom</code> event emitted by the client.
    </li>
    <li>
      Upon receiving the event, the server checks if a room with the specified <code>room_id</code> already exists in the <code>roomList</code> map.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the room already exists, the server responds to the client with the callback function, passing the string <code>'already exists'</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the room does not exist, the server logs a message indicating that a new room has been created, and then proceeds to perform the following steps:
      <ul>
        <li>
          It calls the <code>getMediasoupWorker()</code> function asynchronously to obtain a Mediasoup worker instance. The details of this function are not provided in the code snippet.
        </li>
        <li>
          It creates a new <code>Room</code> instance, passing in the <code>room_id</code>, obtained worker, and <code>io</code> (socket.io instance) as parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
          It adds the newly created room to the <code>roomList</code> map, using the <code>room_id</code> as the key and the <code>Room</code> instance as the value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, it responds to the client with the callback function, passing the <code>room_id</code> as the result.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If any error occurs during the process, an exception is thrown and caught by the surrounding <code>try-catch</code> block. The error is returned as a response.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <pre><code>
// Client-side code
const socket = io();

socket.emit('createRoom', { room_id: "my_room" }, (result) => {
  if (result === 'already exists') {
    console.log('Room already exists');
  } else {
    console.log('Room created:', result);
  }
});
  </code></pre>

  <h1>Socket for Adding a Peer to a Room</h1>

  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This code snippet represents a socket event handler for adding a peer to a specific room. The event is triggered when a client socket emits the <code>join</code> event to the server.
  </p>

  <h3>Code Explanation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The <code>socket.on('join', ...)</code> function listens for the <code>join</code> event emitted by the client socket.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the specified room does not exist in the <code>roomList</code>, the server invokes the callback function passed as the second parameter to the event listener, passing in an error object with a message indicating that the room does not exist.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the specified room exists, the server creates a new <code>Peer</code> instance with the socket's ID and user's name, and adds it to the corresponding <code>Room</code> instance in the <code>roomList</code> by calling the <code>addPeer()</code> method.
    </li>
    <li>
      The server sets the socket's <code>room_id</code> to the specified room ID.
    </li>
    <li>
      The server invokes the callback function passed as the second parameter to the event listener, passing in the JSON representation of the corresponding <code>Room</code> instance in the <code>roomList</code>. This allows the client to receive information about the room and its peers.
    </li>
    <li>
      If an error occurs during the handling process, an error object will be thrown and returned.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>Here's an example of how you can use this code snippet in your application:</p>
  <pre>
    <code>

  // Emitting 'join' event to join a room
  socket.emit('join', {
    room_id: '1234',
    name: 'John'
  }, (response) => {
    if (response.error) {
      console.log(response.error)
    } else {
      console.log(response)
    }
  })
    </code>
  </pre>
In this example, we emit a 'join' event to join the room with ID '1234' and name 'John'. The server responds with a JSON representation of the corresponding room in the roomList. If an error occurs, it will be logged to the console.

  <h1>Socket for Handling Producer Closure</h1>

  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This code snippet represents a socket event handler for handling the closure of a producer. The event is triggered when a producer is closed by the client.
  </p>

  <h3>Code Explanation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The <code>socket.on('producerClosed', ...)</code> function listens for the <code>producerClosed</code> event emitted by the client socket.
    </li>
    <li>
      Upon receiving the event, the server checks if the name of the closed producer matches the name of the first producer. If they match, it stops recording and saves the video file.
    </li>
    <li>
      The server then uses the FFmpeg library to merge the recorded videos into a single video file. The input videos are specified as <code>input1</code> and <code>input2</code>, and the output file is specified as <code>output</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the merging process completes successfully, a success message is logged. If an error occurs during the merging process, an error message is logged.
    </li>
    <li>
      After the merging process (if applicable), a message is logged indicating that a producer has been closed, along with the name of the user obtained from the <code>roomList</code>. This assumes that the user's name is stored in the corresponding <code>Room</code> instance within the <code>roomList</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, the server calls the <code>closeProducer()</code> method on the corresponding <code>Room</code> instance in the <code>roomList</code>, passing in the socket's ID and producer ID as parameters to remove the closed producer from the room.
    </li>
    <li>
      If an error occurs during the handling process, an error object will be thrown and returned.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Example</h3>

    <code>
        // Client-side code
        const socket = io();
      
        // Handle producer closure
        socket.on('producerClosed', ({ producer_id }) => {
          // Additional logic or actions can be implemented here
        });

  <h1>Socket for Exiting a Room</h1>

  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This code snippet represents a socket event handler for handling the exit of a user from a room. The event is triggered when a client socket emits the <code>exitRoom</code> event to the server.
  </p>

  <h3>Code Explanation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The <code>socket.on('exitRoom', ...)</code> function listens for the <code>exitRoom</code> event emitted by the client socket.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the socket is not currently in a room, the server invokes the callback function passed as the second parameter to the event listener, passing in an error object with a message indicating that the user is not currently in a room.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the socket is currently in a room, the server removes the peer associated with the socket's ID from the corresponding <code>Room</code> instance in the <code>roomList</code> by calling the <code>removePeer()</code> method, passing in the socket's ID as a parameter. If there are no more peers in the room after removing the peer associated with the socket's ID, the server deletes the corresponding <code>Room</code> instance from the <code>roomList</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The server sets the socket's <code>room_id</code> to <code>null</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The server invokes the callback function passed as the second parameter to the event listener, passing in a success message indicating that the user has successfully exited the room.
    </li>
    <li>
      If an error occurs during the handling process, an error object will be thrown and returned.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Example</h3>

  <pre>
    <code>
        // Client-side code
        const socket = io();
      
        // Handle exiting room
        socket.emit('exitRoom', null, (response) => {
          if (response.error) {
            console.log(response.error);
            // Additional error handling can be implemented here
          } else {
            console.log(response);
            // Additional logic or actions can be implemented here
          }
        });
